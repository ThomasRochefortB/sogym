The environment is based on the topology optimization framework of Moving Morphable Components [1]. The design task is framed as a sequential decision process where at each timestep, the agent has to place one components.

The environment consists of a 2 x 1 rectangular beam and the boundary conditions are randombly varied between episodes according to the following 6 loading cases:

The blue wall represents a fully supported boundary and the red boundary the region where a unit load with varying orientation is randomly placed.

The environment's reward function can be modified to fit multiple constrained topology optimization objectives such as:

* Compliance minimization under volume constraint [Implemented]
* Compliance minimization under global/local stress constraint
* Volume minimization under compliance constraint
* Combined volume and compliance minimzation
